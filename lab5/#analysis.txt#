My file contains the alphabet in order. When entered into the binary search tree it will place each new object in the right node; therefore, the entire tree will be a linked list of nodes to the right. However, when it's entered into the AVL tree, it will make a series of rotations to balance the tree. If we search for z in each tree AVL will perform much faster. The binary tree will have to check through every single other node before it will find z.
